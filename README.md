EndomondoApi
============

Simple Endomondo Api Class


Quick and simple class designed to access some of the Endomondo data using the same way that mobile endomondo app is using. 
Since endomondo doesn't provide any official api I had to improvise and retrieve that information some other way. Many interesting informations can be found that and only that way ex. gps coords of a place wnere person were when sond started to play. 0.o! Creepy. I know.
